## Data Science Algorithms - Python

Implementation of data science algorithms using python. This project consists of the following algorithms:

  * Naive Bayes Classifier.


### Data Sets
 * pima-indians-diabetes.data - Pima Indians Diabetes Database ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/pima-indians-diabetes )


### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a brief idea on setting up the environment and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

**Prerequisities**

- python2.7


**Setup and running tests**

1. Run `python -V` to check the installation
   
2. Install all the required libraries.
           
3. Execute the following commands from terminal to run the tests:

      `python naivebayesclassifier.py`
